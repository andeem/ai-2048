# Weekly report, week 2
## Progression
* Continued writing the game implementation
## Learning experience
* I tried to use TDD as much as possible, and found it very efficient
* Though for simpler use cases, it is easier to write mock class by yourself, mockito is more efficient way when the class under test grows larger

## Problems or challenging topics
There might be need for additional data structures, like linked list providing random access.

During this week not enough hours were spent on this project, so I need to catch up next week. But luckily the game logic is pretty much done, and I can start working with the AI quite soon.

## Next week
Finalize the game logic and start working with the AI

## Hours
* 12.9 2h: TDDing board class
* 13.9 4h: TDDing board class and working with the structural design
