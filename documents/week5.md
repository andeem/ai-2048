# Weekly report, week 5
## Progression
* Finished MCTS implementation, started working with own data structures, performance testing with simulation options for MCTS simulation step, documentation
## Learning experience
* MCTS understanding
* Importance of unit testing
* There is no big difference between different strategies for selecting random game inside MCTS simulation step.
## Problems or challenging topics
*Simulation options are still quite poor in regards of performance
## Next week
Start with own datastructures, write tests
Figure out better way to select "random" playouts inside MCTS simulation step
Continue with implementation and testing documents
## Hours
* 1.10 6h: Finalizing AI
* 5.10 4h: Documenting, performance testing for different simulation options
