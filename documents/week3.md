# Weekly report, week 2
## Progression
* Continued writing the game implementation, started writing the AI implementation
## Learning experience
* MCTS implementation differs from first expectations, but it seems quite simple still

## Problems or challenging topics
* Last week I fell little behind on schedule and I could not quite catch up as much as was needed. But AI implementation progressed quite well.
* I fell behind at writing tests, need to catch up.
* Code is quite ugly at times, needs refactoring.
* I need to remind myself about reference variables, they have given me some hard time. On the bright side, when debugging, it was quite obvious what caused the problems.
## Next week
Get the AI done, start with own datastructures, clean code(!!) and write tests
## Hours
* 17.9 1h: Writing game class and tests
* 20.9 2h: Writing game class and started AI class
* 21.9 4.5h: Writing the AI class, week report
